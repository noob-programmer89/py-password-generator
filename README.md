# PyPassword Generator
This Python script generates a random password based on user input. It prompts the user to specify the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password.

## Requirements
> Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password.
3. The script will generate a random password based on the input.
4. The generated password will be displayed on the console.

## Optimization
The code has been optimized for better performance by using the join() method to concatenate the characters in the password list. This avoids creating unnecessary intermediate string objects and improves efficiency.
